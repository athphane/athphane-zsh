My ZSH plugin that contains all of my custom scripts and utilities for a better development environment and CLI experience. 

I am mainly a PHP/Laravel developer so a lot of the features in this repository is geared towards PHP development. I do not use Docker containers for development. I have a local version of nginx installed and mutliple different versions of PHP installed as well. 

I use Arch on my coding machine so I am able to maintain multiple PHP versions easily using the AUR.

## Features
- Docker Compose helper function to use the same environment file at all times. 
- Hastebin cli command to make quick pastes.
- Shortened Laravel commands/aliases.
- Single command to create nginx config for the correct php version of a project
- single command to create databases based on project name
- Dynamic PHP version switcher based on project's composer.json PHP version
